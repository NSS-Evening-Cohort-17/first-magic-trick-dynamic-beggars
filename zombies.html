                            terrorized by a fear of the undead. Archaeologists have

                            Zombie folklore has been around for centuries in Haiti, 
                            possibly originating in the 17th century when West African 
                            slaves were brought in to work on Haiti’s sugar cane plantations. 
                            Brutal conditions left the slaves longing for freedom. According 
                            to some reports, the life—or rather afterlife—of a zombie represented 
                            the horrific plight of slavery.

                                <p class="film-bio">Robert Neville (Will Smith) is a scientist who was unable to stop the spread of the terrible virus
                                    that was incurable and man-made in this post-apocalyptic action thriller. Immune, Neville is now the last human survivor
                                    in what is left of New York City and perhaps the world. For three years, Neville has faithfully sent out daily radio messages,
                                    desperate to find any other survivors who might be out there. But he is not alone. Mutant victims of the plague - the Infected
                                    - lurk in the shadows - watching Neville's every move - waiting for him to make a fatal mistake. Perhaps mankind's last, best hope,
                                    Neville is driven by only one remaining mission: to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus using his own immune blood. But
                                    he knows he is outnumbered - and quickly running out of time.—Warner Bros. Pictures</p>
